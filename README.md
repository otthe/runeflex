# Runeflex [ARCHIVED]
Includes your up-to-date OSRS stats into your markdown CV, or anything that supports ```<svg>```.

## Instructions
1. Include the code below into your README.md or similar. <br> ! Remember to replace 'YOUR USERNAME' with your RSN ! <br>
WARNING! If your name contains whitespaces, replace them with ```%20```

```bash
![](https://runeflex-fcc9ee465ad5.herokuapp.com/flex?rsn=YOUR_USERNAME)
```
2. After that, you should see your runescape stats appear in an SVG image

## Example
Maybe you see this? :D <br>

## Things to consider
Serving the image might take a while if the heroku dyno I am using is sleeping.
